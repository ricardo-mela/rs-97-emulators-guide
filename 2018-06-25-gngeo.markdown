**GNGEO, the guide**

GNGEO is a Neo Geo emulator that has been around for a while. It has good performance and lots of cool features, like savestates. Runs very well on the RS-97.

**Config**

First, set up some directories on your ROMS partition.

For this example, I am using v1.9 external SD firmware.

I will store my roms in ``roms/fba``.

This, on the RS-97 OS, will map to ``/mnt/int_sd/roms/fba``

In order to make GNGEO pick the correct ROM folder (which you will need to execute it and run your ROMs) you can edit the file on ``/mnt/int_sd/.gngeo`` named ``gngeorc`` and add the path to the rompath directive at the beginning of the file, like this:
```
rompath /mnt/int_sd/roms/fba
```

Save it and exit.

Once done, you are good to go :) 

The top button will get you back to the main emulator menu if need be.
