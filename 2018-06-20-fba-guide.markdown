Greetings! This is my first attempt at a guide, so bear with me on this.

**Final Burn Alpha, the guide**

[Main GitHub page][fba-github]

FBA is an arcade emulator with less games than MAME, but still very popular and somewhat easier to use.

**Config**

First, set up some directories on your ROMS partition.

For this example, I am using v1.8.1 external SD firmware.

I will store my roms in ``roms/fba``.

This, on the RS-97 OS, will map to ``/mnt/int_sd/roms/fba``

To easily modify the ROM paths (which you will need) you can edit the file on ``/mnt/int_sd/.fba`` named ``fbasdl.ini`` and add the path to any of the the 
```
szAppRomPaths[x] 
```
lines, like this:
```
szAppRomPaths[x] /mnt/int_sd/roms/fba/
```
Notice the trailing slash at the end of it.

This config is analogous for the FBA A320 version, just check the ``.fba_a320`` folder and edit the ``fbasdl.ini`` found there.
