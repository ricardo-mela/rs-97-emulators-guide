**How do I exit emulation?**

OK, I tested the emulator, it works, but I can't exit!

Here is a quick list of the commands that send you back to the menu for some of the emulators I tested.


**Emulator** | **Command**
---- | ----
OhBoy | Press L+R
Gambatte | Press the top button
FCEUX | Press the top button
reGBA | Press the top button
gpsp | Press X
PocketSNES | Press the top button
SNES9X | SELECT + START (says it as soon as emulation starts)
